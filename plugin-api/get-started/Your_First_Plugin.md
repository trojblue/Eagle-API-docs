## Open the plugin directory in the code editor

The plugin project has been created successfully.

At this point, you can use Visual Studio Code or other code editors to open this folder. The plugin is composed of multiple files, and you need to edit these files simultaneously, so you need to open the entire folder, not just one of the files.
